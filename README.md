# Emergency Vehicle Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## üìå Overview  
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of **emergency** vs **non-emergency** vehicles.  
The system is designed with dropout layers and optimized training to reduce overfitting, and results are evaluated using accuracy, loss curves, and a confusion matrix.  

Potential applications include:  
- Smart traffic management (prioritizing emergency vehicles)  
- Autonomous vehicle systems with emergency response recognition

## üîç Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Resizing, normalization, and data augmentation (flips, rotations)  
2. **Model Architecture**  
   - Convolutional + MaxPooling layers  
   - Dropout layers to mitigate overfitting  
   - Fully connected dense layers with softmax output  
3. **Training**  
   - Optimizer: Adam  
   - Loss: Categorical Cross-Entropy  
   - Regularization via dropout and early stopping  
4. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy and loss curves  
   - Confusion matrix and classification report

## üìä Results & Insights  
- **Classification Report:**  
  - Accuracy = **85%**  
  - Precision = 0.83 (non-emergency), 0.88 (emergency)  
  - Recall = 0.85 (non-emergency), 0.86 (emergency)  
  - Macro F1 = **0.85**  
- Balanced performance across both classes.  
- Dropout successfully reduced overfitting and improved generalization.
